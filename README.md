Details of the activities in this workshop
==========================================

1.  setup the development environment

2.  Use the default generated GraphWalker project as our first project,
    > we will add application code and the test methods

    a.  Add target application code according to generated Model and
        > test skeleton

    b.  Enrich the test methods to test the target application code

3.  Create a Model-Based testing integration CLI test for a Binary
    > Search Tree code.

    a.  Create a working Binary Search Tree project

    b.  Add Model Based testing test framework for testing it

        i.  Create the model/s

        ii. Create a MBT solution that is executed and managed by JUnit
            > & GraphWalker

        iii. Create MBT solution that is executed and managed by the
             > test class itself, and which traversed according to a
             > GraphWalker running service decisions
